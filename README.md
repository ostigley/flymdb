#FlyMDB

###This site is a work in progress. 
This is small application that tells a user what movies are playing on their long distance flight, and provides the imdb and rotten tomatoes ratings for those movies. 

This was inspired by my previous long haul travel, getting on a plane and not recognising any of the titles on the system.  I've never heard of any of those movies?!

A user can visit flymdb before they fly, and download a list of rated movies.
